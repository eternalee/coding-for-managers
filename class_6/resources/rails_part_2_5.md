# Intro to Rails (Part 2)

## What you will learn in this course
* Working with the controller
* Routing
* Starting the view layer

## Let's review what we've done so far:

* We've created a Post model
* We've created RESTful routes to interact with our Post model
* We've created a PostsController which has actions that our routes will map to in order to perform CRUD operations

**Which actions are we missing in order to have a fully functional CRUD api for our Posts?**
