* [Other APIs to Learn](https://www.codecademy.com/apis)

### Recommended Ongoing Learning

- I *highly* recommend reading [The Ruby on Rails Turorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/book) and the articles referenced in it as well as completing the project in this book through c9.io.  This is an excellent tutorial that reinforces the core concepts of this course.

- I also recommend something like [exercism.io](http://exercism.io/) or [coderbyte](https://coderbyte.com/challenges#easyChals) as a way to pactice simple programming challenges to stay sharp or prepare for a technical interview.
